# Pac-Man in Python
This project is an attempt at recreating the classic game **Pac-Man** as accurately as possible using Python. From player and ghost movement to animation and sound design, everything is made to be as close as possible to the original game. The python library used to achieve this is [pygame](https://github.com/pygame/).
